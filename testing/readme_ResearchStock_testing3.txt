The goals of ResearchStock_testing3.html was to expand on the ability to parse and manipulate Stock API (now IEX) data. Beyond the general data being obtained from the previous checkpoint, the program was now obtaining general company infomation, overview statistics, finanicals, and similar equities of the searched stocks from the API. All the information was till provided in JSON, allowing Javascript to be continued to be in use to obtain and work with data. Furthemore, CSS was used extensively, specifically Grid and Bootstrap to style the webpage into a more organized user interface with a define standard in fonts and weights as well as a tiled look. In order to run this page, it has to be opened in a common browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.) and then a proper stock ticker such as tsla for Tesla Inc. must be entered to view results.
