The goal of API_testing1.html was to learn and test access to an API with stock market API, in this case Alpha Vantage. Javascript was used to request and gain access to the API and then the daily data of Tesla Inc. over several years was obtained. Once the data was received, it was outputted exactly how it was received, in JSON format. In order to run this page, it just has to be opened in a common browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.) and the program will automatically obtain the data.
