For this part of the portfolio, we wanted to have the user be abe to see what they have invested in. With all the websites has to offer, the user still needs a place where they have everything oganized for them. The stock table, we will output all the stocks that the user has invested in. Along with that is the amount that they own at the ceratina amount of time. This amount is only the left over money value that they actually own. Any other investments that haven't made any final transistions back for the user for a profit will not be included.


We do this from pulling data from our database for the user. The user will go into their portfolio and choose what what league they want to look at. All leagues will be differnt for the user, so it is important that wen have their information seperated between the league choice menu.


The code can be tested by compiling the php file in XAMPP or something similar. The user will run the code and be presented with a box which will display what league they want to choose. Once a lague is chosen, the user will have a display of all the investments that they currently have, along with the balance on they cuurency they currently own
