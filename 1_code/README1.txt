Setting up Server as Local Host
	In order to currently access the Trade Kings web application, it needs to be locally hosted at this stage. So additional software needs to be used to locally run on a server on your machine. Any software that can host a server so that php can run would work, but a software that was tested to work is XAMPP. So once XAMPP is downloaded, a control panel will appear. If it doesn't appear, it can be opened by simply running the downloaded XAMPP application after installation and the control panel will pop up. In order for the Trade Kings website to work, only the Apache server needs to be started. After clicking on the "start" button, you will know that it has started because it will provide the active port numbers and PIDs.  

Putting Files on Server
	In order to run the files, they have to be placed on the active  server. For XAMPP, locate the XAMPP folder and find the htdocs folder inside of it. Then place the entire folder of code inside the htdocs folder. 

Accessing website from server
	Once files are successfully placed on the server, you can open a browser such as Chrome and type in the "localhost/1_code/login.php". This will direct you to the main login page of the website. The entire site is now operational through user interaction.
