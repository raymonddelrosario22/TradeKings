The goal of API_testing2 was to be able to parse and manipulate date provided by the stock API and to automate the process. Using CSS and Javascript, a search bar was implemented with a submit button that would take as input a stock ticker or symbol and go on to output based on the input. Javascript was used more extensively to parse the provided JSON data based on the search to display the symbol, current price and change. Using arrays, time series data was stored and then used to create a line graph illustrating daily change in the searched stock over an extensive time period. Minor amounts CSS styling was starting to be implemented to see possible organization and view of data. In order to run this page, it has to be opened in a common browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.) and then a proper stock ticker such as tsla for Tesla Inc. must be entered to view results.
